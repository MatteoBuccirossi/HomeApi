A cool experiment with node express, angular and python: it reads aloud messages sent through a custom website

The server is written in node using the express framework, the frontend was made using Angular (maybe a bit overkill for a two page website but whatever),
and python was used to fetch the messages from the server and read them out loud through a speaker in my room. I also hooked it up to the lights in my house.
